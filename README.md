I successfully designed and implemented crucial authentication features for our application, including the login page, forgot password functionality, and the reset password page. Utilizing React, TypeScript, Postman, C# and .Net. I ensured a seamless and secure user experience, enhancing the overall accessibility and functionality of our platform.


Alongside the authentication modules, I utilized Azure APIs and AI Weather Reporting to craft a feature-rich map. This map not only visualizes routes but also incorporates a weather layer, allowing users to assess potential disruptions. Furthermore, I implemented endpoints enabling users to pinpoint both the origin and destination of their routes, catering specifically to delivery-related requirements. Included within the map functionality is a comprehensive search feature, enabling users to filter deliveries based on dates, locations, routes, and carriers. The seamlessly integrated search filter produces a list of relevant results, providing users with a concise overview. Each list item is interactive, allowing users to click and instantly visualize the selected delivery on the map. This enhanced user interface fosters efficient planning and tracking of deliveries within the application.

Furthermore, I designed and implemented a user-friendly form on the third page to facilitate seamless package pickup and delivery requests. This intuitive form empowers users to specify their preferences, including preferred carrier, delivery time, location details, and vehicle type. By incorporating these customizable options, the platform streamlines the request process, enhancing the overall user experience for package logistics.

Additionally, I developed a dedicated support page aimed at assisting users in reporting any issues they encounter on the website or with their orders. This user-centric support interface serves as a valuable resource for addressing concerns promptly and ensuring a smooth resolution process, enhancing overall user satisfaction and engagement.
